## Welcome to Database Adapter

We're working on a universal database adapter that would allow to expose your on-promise or cloud-based data source (such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) via a GraphQL API endpoint.

Please, follow us on Twitter ([@dbadapter](https://twitter.com/dbadapter)) for updates.
